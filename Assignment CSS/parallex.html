		<p>
			Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the Solar System, it is third closest to the Sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.<br>
			<br>nature is nothing but the soil,water,fire,air,creatures.<br> Plants and animals

		<h2>Soil</h2>

	<!--Content of first parallax -->
	<div class="para-2">
		<p>
            Soil is the loose surface material that covers most land. It consists of inorganic particles and organic matter. Soil provides the structural support to plants used in agriculture and is also their source of water and nutrients.
            Soils vary greatly in their chemical and physical properties. Processes such as leaching, weathering and microbial activity combine to make a whole range of different soil types. Each type has particular strengths and weaknesses for agricultural production.

	<div class="parallax-1">
		<h2>Air</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="para-2">
		<p>Air is the invisible mixture of gases that surrounds the Earth. Air contains important substances, such as oxygen and nitrogen, that most species need to survive. Human beings, of course, are one of those species. Sometimes, the word "atmosphere" is used instead of the word "air."

		<h2>water</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="para-2">
		<p>water, a substance composed of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen and existing in gaseous, liquid, and solid states. It is one of the most plentiful and essential of compounds. A tasteless and odourless liquid at room temperature, it has the important ability to dissolve many other substances.
